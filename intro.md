This app explores data from [a research paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22755-2) that evaluated THC and CBD measurements of cannabis products in Washington State. Start by selecting a strain type and a strain name from the left. The charts below will display the THC measurements across different suppliers and over time for that strain.

More details about the dataset are available via the help buttons on the left.

💡 This app was built to be an example for many of the ideas I've written down in my notes on [Streamlitopedia](https://pmbaumgartner.github.io/streamlitopedia/)

💻 The code is available [here](https://github.com/pmbaumgartner/dank-data-explorer).
